//        Create a class called Person that represents a person, with properties for their name and age.
//        The Person class should have a constructor that takes two parameters:
//        a String for the person's name and an int for their age.
//        The constructor should set the initial values of the name and age properties based on the passed-in values.
//        Once you have created the Person class and its constructor, create two Person objects:
//        one representing a person named "Alice" who is 25 years old, and another representing a person named "Bob" who is 30 years old.
//        Then print out the name and age properties of each Person object.
